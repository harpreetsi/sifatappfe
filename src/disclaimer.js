1. General Program Participation
I understand that the School of Indian Folk Arts and Tradition Inc. (SIFAT) offers a variety of programs to teach and promote folk arts and traditions, which may include—but are not limited to—group or private classes, workshops, performances, competitions, social functions, and fundraisers. These programs may be conducted either directly by SIFAT or by affiliated third-party instructors or organizations using SIFAT's venues.

I acknowledge that all class fees must be paid in full before attending any class.
All subscription fees are non-refundable and non-transferable. All sales are final.
SIFAT requires a minimum of five participants to run a class. Classes may be canceled if this requirement is not met.
Subscription cancellation requests must be made at least two weeks prior to the next due date, otherwise payment will be processed automatically.
Subscription change requests must also be submitted two weeks in advance of the next billing cycle.

Students may not reproduce, share, or commercially use any routines, choreography, or exercises taught in class without written permission from SIFAT.

I agree to release, indemnify, and hold harmless SIFAT, its staff, instructors, volunteers, and venue providers from any claims related to personal injury, medical conditions, property damage, theft, or loss, before, during, or after class participation.


7. Medical Emergencies
I agree that in case of an emergency, SIFAT may seek appropriate medical assistance.
If I or my child has a medical condition, I will submit a No Objection Certificate from a physician stating fitness to participate and will ensure all necessary medication is brought to class. SIFAT staff will not administer medication.
